"""
games/werewolf/env.py

Minimal Werewolf game environment.

Setup
-----
N players (one is the AI agent, the rest are rule-based NPCs).
Roles are assigned at construction: one werewolf (possibly the AI agent),
the rest villagers.

Phases
------
DAY_DISCUSS  – each player speaks once in turn order.
DAY_VOTE     – each player votes to eliminate one other player.
NIGHT        – if the AI agent is the werewolf, they pick a target to kill.
               Otherwise the werewolf NPC picks randomly.

Win conditions
--------------
Village wins : all werewolves are eliminated.
Werewolf wins: werewolves >= surviving villagers.

Kripke model (initial_kripke)
------------------------------
Propositions: role_<player> ∈ {"werewolf", "villager"} for each player.
Our agent knows their own role; for each other player we create one world
per possible role they could occupy (consistent with global role counts).
Accessibility for other agents is derived from what they have been told —
villagers only know their own role, so their accessible worlds are all
assignments consistent with that.
